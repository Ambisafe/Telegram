How to build:

Step 1: Clone this Repo recursively to your computer:
git clone https://github.com/peter-iakovlev/Telegram.git --recursive

Reference: #265
If there is an error saying that cloning SSignalKit and MtProtoKit are permission denied, you can manually navigate to their folder: submodules/MtProtoKit and thirdparty/SSignalKit, and clone from their repo manually.

Reference: #290
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote

Step 2: Launch Telegraph.xcworkspace (assuming you installed Xcode 9+)

Step 3: Create a config.h containing the App ID and App Hash you created in Telegram API console

#define SETUP_API_ID(apiId) apiId = 12345;
#define SETUP_API_HASH(apiHash) apiHash = @"put your hash here";
Reference: #34

Step 4: Change all instances of ../../config.h to ../config.h

Step 5: Build (at this moment, there is a compile error due to the changed method signature in MTDatacenterAddress.h; hope they'll resolve soon...)

Step 6: Run in Simulator
